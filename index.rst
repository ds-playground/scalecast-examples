Scalecast Example Notebooks
==============================================

Welcome! The first notebook introduces the package, its models, and most of what it can do. The next notebooks review a specific model type available in scalecast. Finally, some auxilary examples, such as how to forecast many series in a loop, display results, and perform other periphery tasks that scalecast is capable of, are presented. Click the links on the sidebar to get started! If you would like to contribute a notebook, email mikekeith52@gmail.com and we will be sure to recognize your contributions.
